# Knowledge Graph Question-generation using Pre-trained Language models

This repository contains the code for the thesis #add thesis link#.

To generate questions for your own graphs, please refer to [this tutorial](notebooks/question_generation_example.ipynb).

All scripts for the training of the models can be found in the [bin](bin/) directory.

In [notebooks](notebooks/) you can find other code for [evaluation](notebooks/evaluation.ipynb), [converting graphs to cypher for Neo4j](notebooks/triples2cypher.ipynb) and [computing data descriptives](notebooks/descriptives.ipynb).
